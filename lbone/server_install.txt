/*****************Before you Install LBone **********************************/

NOTE: If you are installing lbone to the cup.eecs.utk.edu/durian.eecs.utk.edu,
you do not have to set any configuration files at this step. They are already
been set with the proper values. You can directly start installation.


1. Update the configuration file lbone.cfg:
-------------------------------------------
	Go to: <lors_src_pkg>/lbone/server/src/lbone.cfg
	Update the lbone.cfg files to reflect the proper port number of lbone
server(line 14), and the proper hostname and port for ldap server (line 12).
The current settings have been set for cup.eecs.utk.edu.
	This file will be used as the configuration file for the lbone server.

2. Modify the lbone_cgi_base.h file:
------------------------------------

    Go to: <lors_src_pkg>/lbone/cgi/include directory.
	Modify lbone_cgi_base.h file. Modify line 43, 44 and 46 to reflect the
correct ldaphost name, ldap port number and ldap password.

/********************End of Installation******************************/

/********************Starting of the Lbone_Server********************/

    Go to the directory where Lbone Server has been installed.
    Go to the directory sbin.
    Run Lbone Server with the following arguments..
    	./lbone_server -pw "<ldap_pass>" -cp <path of the config file>
    
	NOTE: The path should not contain the name of the config file. If the cfg
file is lbone.cfg and contained in /home/xyz directory, then the path will only
be /home/xyz/, NOT /home/xyz/lbone.cfg.

/*********************************************************************/


/*********************CGI FILES***************************************/

	lbone installation produces 4 cgi scripts.
		lbone_depot_view.cgi
		lbone_depot_modify.cgi
		lbone_depot_delete.cgi
		lbone_list_view.cgi
	They can be found in <Lbone_server_directory>/bin/.
	They should be used in conjunction with the other cgi and html files
located in the cup.eecs.utk.edu machine.
	
/***********************************************************************/




OPENLDAP configuration.
  SCHEMA:
    copy local.schema to the location of your schema directory. you may name
    the file whatever you wish, provided it is included through your
    slapd.conf file
 
  SLAPD.CONF
    It should look similar to the provided slapd.conf file. You
    may wish to change your rootpw to a more discrete value.  This is the
    same value you will put in cgi/include/lbone_cgi_base.h for the password.
    A mis-match will break only the cgi pages.

  BEGIN:
    once you have populated the database with information, you may start the
    ldap server.

    slapd -f slapd.conf -h ldap://yourhostname:portnum

    where <yourhostname> is your hostname and <portnum> is the desired port
    you wish to run the server.  These are the same values you placed in
    lbone_cgi_base.h

  DATABASE:
    After starting your slapd server, you may wish to populate the ldap
    database with the location information of your area.  Provided are
    zipcodes within the US, and airport codes from around the world.

    As a minimum, you will need to add the root.ldif definitions.  These
    providea 'root directory' to add zipcodes, or country codes, or whatever
    you'd like later.  This is done as follows:

    ldapadd -x -wlbone -H ldap://yourhost.name:<portnum> -D "cn=root,o=lbone" \
                -f root.ldif

    continue with as many of the ldif files as you'd like. Some provide only a
    template of possible information. For instance,

    ldapadd -x -wlbone -H ldap://yourhost.name:6776 -D "cn=root,o=lbone" \
                -f zips.ldif

    To verify that the data has been added, you may check with ldapsearch.

    ldapsearch -x -h <yourldapserver>:<portnum> -w '<yourpasswd>' -b 'o=lbone' \
            -LLL "(objectclass=*)"

    This will dump everything under Organization lbone. You may further
    restrict the search by zipcodes, for example, by changing the 'base dn'
    (or base distinguished name, in ldap parlance).

    ldapsearch -x -h <yourldapserver>:<portnum> -w '<yourpasswd>' \
            -b 'ou=zipcodes,o=lbone' -LLL "(objectclass=*)"

    This is analogous to moving up in a filesystem hierarchy.  In a unix like
    fs, you would have /lbone/zipcodes/zip. In ldap, the hierarcy is read
    right to left, rather than left to right.


LBONE CONFIGURATION:
  WEB:
    After starting the slapd server you should now be able to add depots via the
    cgi page. lbone_list_view.cgi will be empty, but click 'Add A Depot' and
    enter the information it asks.

    You will want to enter at least one valid depot before starting the
    lbone_server.

  LBONE SERVER:
  options:
     [-cp <path>]      : the absolute path to find the config file
     [-lh <ldap host>] : the ldap server to use
     [-p  <port>]      : the port to use [1024 < port < 65353]
     [-no-poll]        : do not poll the depots to update the ldap server
                         (for use with slave ldap servers)
     
     lbone_server -cp /absolute/path/lbone.cfg -pw <your ldap passwd>

     the provided lbone.cfg should be altered to reflect your hostnames.

  SHUTDOWN:
     To safely shutdown the ldap server send it the INT signal via 'kill' or
     some other signal sender thingy. You risk loss or corruption of your lbone
     database otherwise. 

     The lbone_server, on the otherhand, is stateless.  Kill it by any means
     you see necessary or appropriate.  You risk losing no data.
